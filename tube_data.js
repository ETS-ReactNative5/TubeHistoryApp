The extension opened in 13th April 1868 and the Bakerloo line station opened here in 10th March 1906.The station takes its name from its location on Baker Street. The origin of the street name is disputed however, the most likely explanation is that it was named after William Baker who leased out the land from Portman Estate and developed the street in 1755. However, there are a number of other people who the street could have been named after, including Sir Edward Baker who owned an estate in the area and Sir Robert Baker who was a prominent magistrate.The street has had many famous residents, both fictional and real. The first famous resident was William Pitt the Younger, who lived on the street for one year (1803-1804) shortly before he died (aged 47). He became the youngest Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1783 at the age of just 24. The most famous resident of all though, is of course the fictitious Sherlock Holmes who lived at 221B.

A house was built on the eastern side of the lane during the reign of Henry III (1216 to 1272) for converting Jews to Christianity and the street was renamed Convers Lane around that time. Later in the 13 Century, during the reign of Edward I, Jews were banned from the country and the house was used by the “keeper of the rolls” who kept the official records for the Inns of Chancery (a group of buildings and legal institutions in London). The road was subsequently renamed Chancellor’s Lane. This was superseded by the name Chancery Lane in 1454, which implies that the Chancellor (or keeper of the rolls) had a personal office or residence on the lane.The original disused station was opened as Chancery Lane on 30 July 1900, approximately 122m to the west of the current station close to where High Holborn meets with CHancery Lane.

{name: "Covent Garden", history: "There has been evidence excavated to suggest that this has been a sacred site since Roman times. In 1200 AD a document mentions a walled garden owned by the Benedictine monks of the Abbey of St Peter (the first church to sit on the site of Westminster Abbey). By the mid 13th century this became a 40 acre quadrangle of mix orchards, meadows and pasture land that lay between modern day St Martin’s Lane and Drury Lane. Documents in 1250 referred to the area as “the garden of the Abbot and Convent of Westminster” and in 1491 it was recorded as Convent Garden. This later changed to Covent Garden as covent was an Anglo-French equivalent word for convent or monastery and was first recorded as the name for the area in 1515.After the dissolution of the monasteries in 1540 Henry VIII took the land for himself and granted it to the John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford, in 1552 and it remained in their family’s hands until 1918. In 1630 the 4th Earl of Bedford, Francis Russell commissioned Inigo Jones to design and build a church and the three terraces of fine houses around a large square.

{name: "Elephant & Castle", history: "Elephant and Castle takes its name from a tavern that was built on the site of the 16th century Newington Theater, which staged many of Shakespeare’s plays. At that time the area was just a small village known as Newington. When the theater shut down, it was converted into a tavern and later into a posting house and inn. The first written record of the tavern comes from 1765 and it was rebuilt in in 1816 and 1898. On the front of the tavern was a model of an elephant carrying a castle on its back. It is not known exactly why the owner decided to name it the Elephant and Castle but it’s possible that it’s due to an association with the Cutlers Company (a trade guild for knife producers) whose emblem was an elephant carrying a castle on it’s back. Over time the town of Newington began to be referred to by the name of it’s famous tavern.The area was badly bombed in the war and underwent reconstruction in the 1950s. In 1959 the tavern was demolished to make way for the new road system. The model elephant that once sat on top of the tavern was preserved and it is currently displayed on a plinth outside the shopping center, which was the first covered shopping centre (or mall) to be built in Europe.

{name: "London Bridge", history: "London Bridge is named after the famous London Bridge that crosses the River Thames here.The first London Bridge was built a short distance to the East of the current one in around 50 AD, although it is likely that the Romans had a floating pontoon type bridge crossing the river even earlier than that. The first bridge was made out of wood and clay but it was destroyed by Queen Boadicea’s army after just ten years. The remnants of this bridge have been excavated and are on display in the station building. It was replaced by a second Roman bridge that eventually fell into disrepair after the Romans left Britain.After King Alfred the Great united Anglo-Saxon England, a new bridge was built in approximately 990 AD. However, this was destroyed in a battle with the Danes in 1014. The well known rhyme “London Bridge is falling down” refers to this.Two more bridges were built and destroyed before the first stone bridge was built in 1176. This bridge had a chapel built in its center, dedicated to the recently martyred Thomas Becket and became the starting point for pilgrimages to Canterbury. The passage way on the bridge was only 6 feet wide, as it was lined on both sides by shops which became the center of London’s gold and silver trade. The heads of many famous traitors were displayed on the bridge’s southern gatehouse, including William Wallace and Guy Fawkes. In 1598, a German visitor counted 30 heads on display. Over the years, many arches collapsed and were replaced, and part of the bridge was burned during the Peasants’ Revolt in 1381.By the 1820’s the medieval bridge was far too narrow to cope with the traffic and a new bridge was built upstream. The 600 year old bridge was demolished and all that survives are two pedestrian alcoves which are currently in Victoria Park. An attempt to widen the new bridge by 4 meters was made in 1902 but this lead to the eastern side starting to sink. It was subsequently put up for sale and sold to Robert P. McCulloch, the US oil tycoon for $2.5 million in 1967.

In the 1860s, excavations of the river discovered large numbers of human skulls and no other bones.

As many as 60,000 people were killed here over almost 600 years. Executions were a public spectacle complete with food and souvenirs, and the rich would often rent out nearby balconies to get the best view.
