{name: "Covent Garden", history: "There has been evidence excavated to suggest that this has been a sacred site since Roman times. In 1200 AD a document mentions a walled garden owned by the Benedictine monks of the Abbey of St Peter (the first church to sit on the site of Westminster Abbey). By the mid 13th century this became a 40 acre quadrangle of mix orchards, meadows and pasture land that lay between modern day St Martin’s Lane and Drury Lane. Documents in 1250 referred to the area as “the garden of the Abbot and Convent of Westminster” and in 1491 it was recorded as Convent Garden. This later changed to Covent Garden as covent was an Anglo-French equivalent word for convent or monastery and was first recorded as the name for the area in 1515.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the monasteries in 1540 Henry VIII took the land for himself and granted it to the John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford, in 1552 and it remained in their family’s hands until 1918. In 1630 the 4th Earl of Bedford, Francis Russell commissioned Inigo Jones to design and build a church and the three terraces of fine houses around a large square. Although this was originally meant to be a residential quarter, Covent Garden became famous for its fruit market (now moved to Vauxhall) which was setup in 1661 and the Royal Opera House which its third and current incarnation was built on the site in 1858.\n\nThe station was opened as Covent Garden on 11 April 1907.", image: require("./images/CoventGarden.jpg"), lines: "Piccadilly\n", localAuthority: "City of Westminster", zones: "1", opened: "11 April 1907", mainlineOpened: "", previousNames: "None"},

{name: "Elephant & Castle", history: "Elephant and Castle takes its name from a tavern that was built on the site of the 16th century Newington Theater, which staged many of Shakespeare’s plays. At that time the area was just a small village known as Newington. When the theater shut down, it was converted into a tavern and later into a posting house and inn. The first written record of the tavern comes from 1765 and it was rebuilt in in 1816 and 1898. On the front of the tavern was a model of an elephant carrying a castle on its back. It is not known exactly why the owner decided to name it the Elephant and Castle but it’s possible that it’s due to an association with the Cutlers Company (a trade guild for knife producers) whose emblem was an elephant carrying a castle on it’s back. Over time the town of Newington began to be referred to by the name of it’s famous tavern.\n\nThe area was badly bombed in the war and underwent reconstruction in the 1950s. In 1959 the tavern was demolished to make way for the new road system. The model elephant that once sat on top of the tavern was preserved and it is currently displayed on a plinth outside the shopping center, which was the first covered shopping centre (or mall) to be built in Europe. A present day pub with the same name sits a short distance from the old site.\n\nIt was originally opened as two separate stations, the first was opened as City and South London Railway (now part of of the Northern line) in 1890 and the second was opened 6 years later as part of the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (the Bakerloo line).

Joseph Bazalgette was commissioned to design a sewer alongside the Thames so that the untreated waste would no longer be sent into the river. Part of the plan included the Embankment Road which sits directly on top of the Victorian sewer. The Act of Parliament o commission the build passed in 1863 and construction was completed by 1870.\n\nThere were originally two seperate stations which were combined and initially given the name of Charing Cross in 1914.

{name: "High Street Kensington", history: "The first written reference to the area was in the Domesday book, written in 1086 on the orders of William the Conqueror, where it was referred to as Cheninton.

The area has had many alternative spellings over the years including Kenesingeton, which was recorded in 1274.\n\nWilliam the Conqueror initially gave Kensington to one of his knights, Geoffrey de Mowbray, but he fell out of favour and it was passed on to Aubrey de Vere who owned land in 9 different countries and was one of the richest aristocrats in the country. His descendants, the Earl’s of Oxford, owned large parts of London for the next 500 years and Earl’s Court is also named after them.\n\nThe “High Street” part of the name refers to the road the station is on, “High Street Kensington”. This was built on the site of an old Roman road and for centuries it remained one of only two roads that ran east to west through London. The first buildings here were built on the south side in the reign of Charles II (1660-85), while the North side was built up during the 1780s.

{name: "Holborn", history: "Holborn was recorded as Holeburne in 951. It is derived from the Old English “holh”, which means hollow and “burna” which means stream. In other words it translates as the stream in the hollow.

It was given to Westminster Abbey by Norman the Conqueror and it remained in their hands util 1536, when Henry VIII seized it from them and turned it into a deer park. In 1635 Charles I opened it to the public.\n\nAmong other things, the park is famous today for Speakers Corner where Karl Marx, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin and George Orwell have all given speeches. It was also the site of original site of Crystal Palace, which housed the Victorian Great Exhibition in 1851. The 110 meter wide Crystal Palace was moved to South London, where it burned down in 1936.\n\nThis corner of Hyde park was significant as there was an entrance to London here, which remained until 1825 when the toll-gate (known as a turnpike) was removed.", image: require("./images/HydeParkCorner.jpg"), lines: "Piccadilly\n", localAuthority: "City of Westminster", zones: "1", opened: "15 December 1906", mainlineOpened: "", previousNames: "None"},

{name: "King's Cross St. Pancras", history: "This district of London was called Battlebridge until 1830. It was named after the legendary battle between Boadicea, the British Queen of the Iceni, and the Romans and took place here in approximately AD 60. At the site of the battle was a bridge over the River Fleet, hence the name Battlebridge. Boadicea allegedly took her own life after the battle, preferring that to being captured by the Romans. Some accounts suggested that she was buried directly beneath Kings Cross station but no remains have ever been discovered and it is likely that this is just a rumour.\n\nIn 1830 King George IV erected a large statue of himself in the middle of the busy crossroads that today forms the entrance to Kings Cross station. The statue wasn’t very popular, (partly because it didn’t look very much like the king) and despite only being completed in 1836, it was taken down in 1845. The name Kings Cross remained though and it had replaced Battlebridge by the mainline station opened in 1850.\n\nSt Pancras was once a small village and later a manor, which was granted by Ethelbert (Kind of Wessex 860-865) to St Paul’s Cathedral. The village took its name from the church that was built there in AD 314 and was in honour of the 14 year old Roman martyr, Saint Pancraticus. It is said to be one of the first christian sites in Britain. The much restored church stills stands behind the station today.\n\nSt Pancras station (opened in 1868) sits on part of the site where Caesar established is camp when he lead the Roman invasion of Britain in BC 50.", image: require("./images/King'sCrossSt.Pancras.jpg"), lines: "Metropolitan\nNorthern\nPiccadilly\nCircle\nVictoria\nHammersmith & City\n", localAuthority: "Camden", zones: "1", opened: "10 January 1863Metropolitan line resited 9 March 1941", mainlineOpened: "", previousNames: "King's Cross (Metropolitan line): 1863–1925\nKing's Cross & St. Pancras (Metropolitan line): 1925–33\nKing's Cross (Piccadilly line): 1906–27\nKing's Cross for St. Pancras (Piccadilly line): 1927–33\nKing's Cross for St. Pancras {Northern line}: 1907–33\n"},

The stream still exists today and runs under knightsbridge through a sewage tunnel.\n\nIt is not entirely clear how Knightsbridge got it’s knightly connection but it may have been a site that was used for jousting tournaments. One story alleges that two knights got into a fight on the bridge while on route to a crusade. Both knights died in the fight and the town became associated and named after the quarrel. Over the years, there have been many variations in it’s spelling and it was recorded as Knyghtesbrugg in 1364.Today Knightsbridge is one of the most expensive places to live in London.

The local people subsequently petitioned King Charles I to have their access reinstated. The King agreed and the field was reopened to the public with the name Leicester Field. Housing started to develop around the grassy square shortly after. The square was later turned into a public garden in 1874 and by this time had already become a popular entertainment venue.

{name: "London Bridge", history: "London Bridge is named after the famous London Bridge that crosses the River Thames here.\n\nThe first London Bridge was built a short distance to the East of the current one in around 50 AD, although it is likely that the Romans had a floating pontoon type bridge crossing the river even earlier than that. The first bridge was made out of wood and clay but it was destroyed by Queen Boadicea’s army after just ten years. The remnants of this bridge have been excavated and are on display in the station building. It was replaced by a second Roman bridge that eventually fell into disrepair after the Romans left Britain.\n\nAfter King Alfred the Great united Anglo-Saxon England, a new bridge was built in approximately 990 AD. However, this was destroyed in a battle with the Danes in 1014. The well known rhyme “London Bridge is falling down” refers to this.\n\nTwo more bridges were built and destroyed before the first stone bridge was built in 1176. This bridge had a chapel built in its center, dedicated to the recently martyred Thomas Becket and became the starting point for pilgrimages to Canterbury. The passage way on the bridge was only 6 feet wide, as it was lined on both sides by shops which became the center of London’s gold and silver trade. The heads of many famous traitors were displayed on the bridge’s southern gatehouse, including William Wallace and Guy Fawkes. In 1598, a German visitor counted 30 heads on display. Over the years, many arches collapsed and were replaced, and part of the bridge was burned during the Peasants’ Revolt in 1381.\n\nBy the 1820’s the medieval bridge was far too narrow to cope with the traffic and a new bridge was built upstream. The 600 year old bridge was demolished and all that survives are two pedestrian alcoves which are currently in Victoria Park. An attempt to widen the new bridge by 4 meters was made in 1902 but this lead to the eastern side starting to sink. It was subsequently put up for sale and sold to Robert P. McCulloch, the US oil tycoon for $2.5 million in 1967. There is a popular rumour that he thought he was buying the much more impressive Tower Bridge.\n\nThe current concrete London Bridge was opened in 1973.\n\nThe mainline station was opened in 1836 and is the oldest in London.", image: require("./images/LondonBridge.jpg"), lines: "Northern\nJubilee\n", localAuthority: "Southwark", zones: "1", opened: "25 February 1900", mainlineOpened: "", previousNames: "None"},

It was a major navigable river in Roman and medieval times and used for drinking water as well as a sewer. In the 1860s, excavations of the river discovered large numbers of human skulls and no other bones.

It was relocated to its current site at the junction between Oxford Street, Park Lane and Edgware Road in 1855.\n\nBetween 1196 and 1783, the site where the arch now stands today was the Tyburn Gallows, London’s main site for execution. As many as 60,000 people were killed here over almost 600 years. Executions were a public spectacle complete with food and souvenirs, and the rich would often rent out nearby balconies to get the best view. Thousands of people would come to watch and at one point stands were erected, which later collapsed killing many spectators in the event.

The land changed hands again several times before it passed on to by Mary Davies who married Sir Thomas Grosvenor at aged 12 in 1677. Their descendants still own most of the land today and were given the title of the Duke of Westminster by Queen Victoria. In 2017 it was estimated that the current Duke of Westminster (aged just 26) is the 9th richest man in the UK.\n\nThe origin of the name isn’t entirely certain. It is said that it was named after Ben Pimlico who ran a popular pub in Hoxton, East London. The pub was famously for it’s nutty brown ale and its drinking gardens. It is not exactly certain how the area became to be named after a pub that was several miles to the East. One possible account is that there was a path to the pub that started here, known as Pimlico Path and the area eventually took on its name. Another plausible reason is that the land here resembled the Pub’s gardens and was named after them.

The defenses remained in use throughout much of London's early history, in 1013 the fortifications were used to hold out against the Danish army of King Swen Fork-Beard during his attempt to invade London. In 1066 they were unsuccessfully used to defend London from William the Conqueror's invasion and they were required again when Thomas Watt’s rebel army fought to replace the Queen Mary.\n\nThe first recorded name for the area is Suthriganawoerc in the 10th century, which means “fort of the men from Surrey”. In the Domesday book (commissioned by William the Conqueror in 1086) it was named as Sudwerca which means “southern defensive fort” and the current name is a variation on this.\n\nSouthwark was the location of Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre, built in 1599.

{name: "Westminster", history: "The name Westminster was first recorded in 785. It is derived from the Old English word mynster, which means monastery or church, and references the fact that it is to the west of the City of London. The site was once home to a Roman temple dedicated to Apollo. The first abbey here was founded in around 600 AD and called Torneia, which means “thorn island”, at that time the area was regularly cut off by the tide making it an island. Westminster Abbey began as a small church attached to the Benedictine monastery, known as St Peter’s Abbey. Between 1042 and 1052 King Edward the Confessor had it rebuilt so that it could be used as a royal burial church. The grander church was called The Collegiate Church of St Peter at Westminster and became widely known as Westminster Abbey.\n\nKing Edward the Confessor also build a palace (Westminster Palace) next to Westminster Abbey so that he could oversee it’s construction. This remained the official Royal residence until 1512 when a fire destroyed a lot of the palace. After the fire King Henry VIII moved the Royal residence to the newly built Palace of Whitehall. The Palace of Westminster was rebuilt so that it could serve as the home of Parliament, which it continues to do to this day. The only surviving buildings from the original Westminster Palace are Westminster Hall, built in 1097, and the jewel tower, built in 1365.", image: require("./images/Westminster.jpg"), lines: "District\nCircle\nJubilee\n", localAuthority: "City of Westminster", zones: "1", opened: "24 December 1868", mainlineOpened: "", previousNames: "Westminster Bridge: 1868–1907"},
