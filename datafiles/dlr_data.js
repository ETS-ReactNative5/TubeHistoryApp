The origin of the name Isle of Dogs is disputed and may be a corruption of the Isle of Ducks. Alternatively it may refer to a pack of greyhounds that were owned by King Henry III and were kennelled in the area.\n\nThe West India Docks were opened here in 1802 by Prime Minister Henry Addington, they became the busiest docks in the world and trade boomed for over 150 years. After the 1960’s trade sharply declined due to new ports at Felixstowe and Tilbury and they eventually closed in the 1980s.\n\nWhen the redevelopment of the area started in in 1988 it was named after the former number 32 wharf on the West Wood Quay, that sat right at the center of the new development site.
